# facial-recognition

Here we tried to implement Facial Recognition using face recognition method. We tried to create a facial recognition system for a event. so for the event, the users/customer needs to register first( by user_registration.py). After they registered, the event management team can track the users who are on the camera whether they are registered or not. If they are registered , then their name and type of ticket they purchased will show on the camera feed. If they are not registered, the box will show "Unknown". And by that we can easily track the users who are entering the event. Also I created a file ( emotion_detection.py) which can track the emotion of the users who are on the camera feed. By checking that, we can easily track the enviorment around the event and can be helpful to prevent possible * escalations.
